This repository contains some of the thing I learn from Alx and and other tutorials on YouTube.

### CLONING A REPOSITORY 
To clone a repository in github to ones local machine use the syntax:
+ <> git clone  <https://PAT@github_repo_link.git>
The repository on github will be immediately cloned to your local machine.
NOTE: PAT - Personal Access Token.

### HOW TO GET YOUR PAT
To get your personal access token 
+ on the home menu click on your profile icon on the top right hand side.
+ on the drop down menu click on  settings- you are redirected to the settings page. 
+ on the left hand side of the settings page scroll down untill you see developers settings, click on it. 
+ TWo options appear OAuth Apps and Personal access token. Click on Personal access token and select Token(classic).
+ On the central pane click on Generate new token, select classic.
+ once the token is generated copy it  and paste in a safe location e.g a notepad, because you wont be able to access the token again once you leave.

+ All done! Now you can use this access token to access general repo.
